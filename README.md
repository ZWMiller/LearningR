# Learning R 

## Macros:

### loadBasebalDB.R
This loads a CSV of all the baseball stats for the MLB and then does many
different manipulations and makes a PDF of plots.

### twoDimGauss.R
This generates some random distributions, then plots them and stores them in a
PDF.

### webCrawler.R
Reads in a URL and then gets the information from there and puts it into
variables that can be used to sort data later
